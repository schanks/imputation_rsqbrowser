# imputation_rsqbrowser

This purpose of this repository is to provide the scripts used in the manuscript “Extent to which array genotyping and imputation with large reference panels approximates deep whole genome sequencing” for the reproduction of key results and figures. 

## Table of contents
1. [arrays](https://github.com/schanks/imputation_rsqbrowser/edit/main/arrays/README.md): Simulate genotyping arrays from WGS files (pre-imputation)
2. [rsqcalc](https://github.com/schanks/imputation_rsqbrowser/tree/main/rsqcalc): Calculate observed imputation r2 (post-imputation). This includes subfolders (a) [analyses](https://github.com/schanks/imputation_rsqbrowser/tree/main/rsqcalc/analyses) and (b) [figures](https://github.com/schanks/imputation_rsqbrowser/tree/main/rsqcalc/figures) detailing generation of intermediate results (data included when possible) and main and supplemental figures, respectively. 

## Data availability
While most of the data used in the paper cannot be provided due to privacy concerns, the variant-level observed imputation r2 results can be downloaded from https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/rsq-browser/downloads.
